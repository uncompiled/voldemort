# Voldemort

This repo exists to summon **You-Know-Who**, **He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named**, otherwise known as the **Dark Lord**.

It does not do anything useful.

## Data Processing Pipeline

- Obtain a facebox from [machinebox.io](https://machinebox.io/)
- Gather images of the person you would like to detect
- Run `voldemort data` to generate the training data in `training/data.json`
- Make sure the facebox is running
- Run `voldemort train` to teach the facebox how to find Tom Riddle.
